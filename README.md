## Pig Dice Game
Pig is a simple dice game first described in print by John Scarne in 1945. Pig is one of a family of dice games described by Reiner Knizia as "jeopardy dice games". For jeopardy dice games, the dominant type of decision is whether or not to jeopardize previous gains by rolling for potential greater gains. Most jeopardy dice games can be further subdivided into two categories: jeopardy race games and jeopardy approach games. In jeopardy race games, the object is to be the first to meet or exceed a goal score (e.g. Pig, Pass the Pigs, Cosmic Wimpout, Can't Stop). In jeopardy approach games, the object is to most closely approach a goal score without exceeding it.[3]

### Program Objective
Allow the game to be played with 2 humans<br>
Game ends when one players Game Total is 100 points or more<br>
Players turn ends when they choose to pass their turn OR they roll a 1<br>
Players accumulate their score with each dice roll, when they pass their turn, that total is added to their Game Total<br>
If a player rolls a 1 their turn score becomes 0 and their turn is automatically passed<br>
Display the current players turn visually or with text on the web page<br>

### Future Enhancements
Implement objects and classes<br>
Player Class (could store name and total score)<br>
Game class(could store whose turn it is, current turn total, and state of game)<br>
Playing a sound when the die is rolled<br>
Show a rolling die when roll is clicked
